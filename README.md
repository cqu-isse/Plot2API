Accepted by SANER2021

# Note
Firstly, you should run the EfficientNet successfully. The link is https://github.com/lukemelas/EfficientNet-PyTorch. 
Then download the datasets. (https://pan.baidu.com/s/16cASGJKdCO1RovJOzcQY7Q, the code is 5230).
The result will be a little different from the paper due to initialization.

## Run
- python>=3.6

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

$ python SPGNN.py -g 0
