Accepted by SANER2021

# Note
Firstly, you should run the EfficientNet successfully. The link is https://github.com/lukemelas/EfficientNet-PyTorch. 
Then download the datasets (https://pan.baidu.com/s/1dvreMIQYeoxLvnkGonVmtQ, the code is ISSE).
The result will be a little different from the paper due to initialization.

## Run
- python>=3.6

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

$ python SPGNN.py -g 0
